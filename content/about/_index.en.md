## Our Story

We are Malhaz and Nata Paliani. Our parents and we were born and raised in Mestia. After getting higher education, we returned to our homeland to work and raise children. Our hotel has been open since 2017 and has been gradually improving. We finished transformation a traditional Svan house into a comfortable hotel in 2022. Our interior combines historical stone walls and modern light. Now, we can accommodate up to 40 guests at once. We want more people to fall in love with Svaneti.
